WebRTC based remote collaborative online learning platform
Hyeontaek Oh, Sanghong Ahn, JunKyun Choi, Jinhong Yang
April 2015 		
AWeS '15: Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on All-Web Real-Time Systems

Notes:
	traditional e-learning systems are not capable of more complex interactions between students and teacher, like real-time questioning, real-time content sharing, etc.
	
	service scenario:
		teachers and students are able to do remote collaborative learning service without degrading streaming quality
		users should be able to use mutliple devices, share their images and display of their devices in teleconferencing environment
		real-time notification and quiz function should be available
		teachers should see the answers and feedback of students
		
	functional requirements:
		platform should support content-sharing regardless of the type of the content
		users should be able to manipulate the on-viewing contents, and the result of the manipulation should be synchronized among related users
		
	service architecture
		three major parts: backend, frontend, application server
		frontend: divided in user interface and lecture modules
		application server: operates three application modules: collaboration learning elements (user communication and interaction, slide show controller and social log management), content syndicator (deals with lecture video content, materials and interaction logs in a lecture session) and session manager (deals with user access and interactions)
		
	layered session model for user-level management and device-level management (so users can log in with multiple devices at the same time)
		
	very good explanation of system architecture and setup!

April 2015 		
AWeS '15: Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on All-Web Real-Time Systems 

Notes:
	HTML5 does not yet provide access to sensors other than GPS and accelerometers
	
	proposal to extend WebRTC APIs to enable general access to sensors
	
	compromise between flexibility and ease of use
	
	sample use case: patient lives far away from a hospital, can plug in his blood pressure sensor, thermometer or other health kits into his smart phone and make it accessible to the doctor

	good explanation of WebRTC audio and video codec

PAPER-5 (*)
On embedded real time media communications
Jean-Charles Grégoire
April 2015 		
AWeS '15: Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on All-Web Real-Time Systems

Notes:
	Advantages of WebRTC:
		OS and platform independence (as long as it is supported by the browser)
		programmability
		dynamic configuration without need for plugins
		support for multiple concurrent communications
		uniformity of features available (i.e. codecs) and hence predictability
		
	Disadvantages of WebRTC:
		platform restrictions - the browser is an environment with limits in communications and storage access (i.e. sandboxing)
		no possibility of extension (additional codecs, other security mechanisms)
		no standard way of integration into a signalling environment
		
	The approach taken in the design of WebRTC is a "one size fits all" approach for media (audio, video, data), while, on the signalling side, it is essentially non-committal, reduced to SDP-bias for the presentation of connection data
	
	Non-telephony applications
		Mediated communications
			identity - an identifier which allows us to recognize the parties involved
			presence - the notion of who is available
			notification - means to notify some other party of a communication
			
		Asymmetric communications
			business communications, like call centers ("click to call" model)
			
		The always-on issue
			always-on hypothesis: a party must always be reachable
			
	Peer-to-peer communications key elements
		Quality of Service
		Trusted identification
		Reachability
		Real presence in a virtual world
		Features
			call display
			selective call blocking
			voice mail
		
		Extended functionalities

P2P shared-caching model: using P2P to improve client-server application performance
Luong Quy Tho, Ha Quoc Trung
December 2013 		
SoICT '13: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Information and Communication Technology

Notes:
	client-server modal has several drawbacks, such as server bottleneck and weak scalability, but works really simple
	caching improves problem, but model remains client-server
	P2P solves this problem
	solution: "Quicknode", hybrid approach between client-server and P2P

P2P live video streaming in WebRTC
Rhinow, F.; Veloso, P.P.; Puyelo, C.; Barrett, S.; Nuallain, E.O.
Computer Applications and Information Systems (WCCAIS), 2014 World Congress on
Year: 2014

Notes:
	aim:
		implement a pull based live video streaming application usign WebRTC

	alternatives:
		IP multicast (1985), to send IP packages to multiple clients, still not widely deployed
		tree based peer-to-peer protocols
		pull based protocols (random neighbords are assigned)
		
	their implementation:
		source publisher: main server
		WebRTC coordinator: same host as source publisher
		WebRTC network
		
	process flow:
		a peer generates a user ID and registers at the PeerJS server and the WebRTC coordinator
		WebRTC coordinator selects pseudo randomly two peers that are already part of the WebRTC network and sends these information to the connection establishing peer
		this peer opens a RTCDataChannel to these two peers and thus is part of the WebRTC network
		as a result, the first peer only subscribes to the source publisher
		the second peer subscribes to the source publisher and the first peer, while the third peer selects randomly two peers from the first, second or source publisher
		thus, a random mesh is created with every new peer which joins the network

WebRTC, the day after
Bertin E., Cubaud S., Tuffin S., Cazeaux S., Crespi N., Beltran V.
2013

Notes:
	general idea: create a Telco platform using WebRTC

	"as all modern telecom architectures, WebRTC is based on the fundamental separation between the media path and the signaling path"
	
	WebRTC is currently being designed by three standardization bodies
		Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
		World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
		3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
		
	"it is worth noting that the WebRTC standars allow for any codec to be negotiated if the browser implementation supports it"
	
	"Which alternative for key exchange will be used for standardization has not yet been decided. For browserto-browser communications that are subject to lawful intercept requirements, there is a significant difference between the two approaches. Implementing lawful intercept with DTLS/SRTP would force the Web service provider to deploy a media relay decrypting and re-encrypting any communication. SRTP/SDES would however allow the Web service provider to duplicate and decrypt only the streams for the intercepted targets, which is usually a small subset of the user base."
	
	"as far as Telcos are concerned, the current technical solutions for these services rely mainly on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)"
	
	"the current IMS model is inherently based on a complete control of the whole technical environment (user device, service provider, service developer, network provider) by a few actors. but the new ecosystem has made it unrealistic for an IMS provider to control the whole targeted devices and the service development mechanism."
