Notes:
	Jonathan Nolen of HipChat explains how they extended their app from text chat to video chat
	Advantages: Platform support, API, UX
	Issues: web developers suddenly have to worry about hardware, broken web-cams, bad video drivers, other applications stealing the camera; you're often at the mercy of the network, and users blame your app
	Insights:
		get stats on everything
			calls attempted, completed, dropped
			repeated short calls between two users
			network quality during calls
			video quality on each end
			get user's feedback at the end of a call
		
		help users help themselves
			self-diagnostic tools are super useful
				a "test sound" button to test your speakers or headset
				indicators that your mic is picking up sound
				camera display so the user can see
				detailed logging that the user can access
