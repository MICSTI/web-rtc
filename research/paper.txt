P2P live video streaming in WebRTC

Year: 2014

Notes:
	aim:
		implement a pull based live video streaming application usign WebRTC

	alternatives:
		IP multicast (1985), to send IP packages to multiple clients, still not widely deployed
		tree based peer-to-peer protocols
		pull based protocols (random neighbords are assigned)
		
	their implementation:
		source publisher: main server
		WebRTC coordinator: same host as source publisher
		WebRTC network
		
	process flow:
		a peer generates a user ID and registers at the PeerJS server and the WebRTC coordinator
		WebRTC coordinator selects pseudo randomly two peers that are already part of the WebRTC network and sends these information to the connection establishing peer
		this peer opens a RTCDataChannel to these two peers and thus is part of the WebRTC network
		as a result, the first peer only subscribes to the source publisher
		the second peer subscribes to the source publisher and the first peer, while the third peer selects randomly two peers from the first, second or source publisher
		thus, a random mesh is created with every new peer which joins the network
